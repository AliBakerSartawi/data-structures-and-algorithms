### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

---

[**Reverse an Array**](./code-challenges/arrayReverse/array-reverse.test.js)

**Challenge**: Array should be reversed without utilizing built-in methods, while applying our own testing code

**Approach & Efficiency**: I tried using the most basic code; a basic for loop and unshifting the values

**Solution**:

*run: npm test array-reverse*
